;; we can use one oscillator as the input to another. Here we control
;; the frequency of a sine wave with another sine wave to produce a
;; vibrato effect:
(definst wobbled-sin [pitch-freq 440 wobble-freq 5 wobble-depth 5]

(comment
  (wobbled-sin)
  ;; you can try it with deeper, slower wobbles:
  (wobbled-sin 440 2 50)
  ;; if you make the wobble much faster, strange sounds emerge:
  (wobbled-sin 440 100 50)

;; Combining the previous two ideas, we have the start of a dubstep
;; oscillator:

;; Sometimes it's better to work with notes rather than
;; frequencies. First we can use MIDI notes, where middle C is defined
;; as 60:

(midi->hz 60)
;;=> 261.62556...

;; an octave is 12 semitones, so we can add 12 to the midi note to get
;; the next octave, which doubles the frequency:
(midi->hz 72)
;;=> 523.2511...

;; use it in a synth like this:
(comment
  (dubstep (midi->hz 60))
  )

;; MIDI notes are more abstract than frequencies, but sometimes it's
;; nicer to work with note names. We can use the note function:

(note :c4)
;;=> 60

(comment
  (dubstep (midi->hz (note :c4)))
  )

;; often, rather than doing the conversion inline, we'll translate a
;; list of notes into a list of frequencies which we'll later play:

(def notes (vec (map (comp midi->hz note) [:c3 :g3 :c3])))
;;=> (130.8127826502993 195.99771799087463 130.8127826502993)
